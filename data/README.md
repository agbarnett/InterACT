# Synthetic data

We created a synthetic version of the data using the methods described in [Quintana](https://elifesciences.org/articles/53275). This was to avoid any risk of patients being identified.

These patient-level data used to examine the in-hospital outcomes of:

* clinician-led care review discussions
* review of care directive measures
* palliative care referrals

The variables in the data are:

* Age (years)
* Gender
* CRiSTAL score
* SPICT score
* Time between admission and outcome (fractional days)
* Intervention group
